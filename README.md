The stats project provides a standard Stats interface to a variety of underlying
backends, along with a means to configure it from command line flags.

## Requirements

- Go 1.10.1 or later (previous versions may work, but we don't build or test against them)

## Dependencies

The stats project depends on these packages:

- [api](https://github.com/turbinelabs/api)
- [idgen](https://github.com/turbinelabs/idgen)
- [nonstdlib](https://github.com/turbinelabs/nonstdlib)

The tests depend on our [test package](https://github.com/turbinelabs/test),
and on [gomock](https://github.com/golang/mock). It should always be safe to use
HEAD of all master branches of Turbine Labs open source projects together, or to
vendor them with the same git tag.

[gomock](https://github.com/golang/mock)-based MockStats and MockFromFlags are provided.

<!-- remove if no vendored dependencies -->
Additionally, we vendor [github.com/rs/xstats](https://github.com/rs/xstats).
This should be considered an opaque implementation detail, see
[Vendoring](http://github.com/turbinelabs/developer/blob/master/README.md#vendoring)
for more discussion.
